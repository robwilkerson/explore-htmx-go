# Todo List

An exploration of Go templates and HTMLX.

This is a functional prototype. It is not, nor does it pretend to be, production-ready code.

## Pre-requisites

* Go 1.21 (earlier versions _might_ be fine as well)
* SQLite3
* Tailwind CSS

## Installation

1. Clone this repo
2. Run the install script

        bash ./install
